# wrap-around-moving-balls


This is a JavaFX program that creates balls in a display window.
There is one red ball and the rest are green.
The balls move at random velocities.
The balls also wrap around the window if they move off screen.
If the red ball collides with a green ball, the green ball is deleted and the red ball gets a new random velocity.
The up and down arrows on keyboard will slow down or speedup the animation.
Clicking the mouse in window will create a new green ball at the location of the pointer.
Clicking and dragging the mouse in the window will create many green balls along the path the mouse was dragged.


Known Bugs:
Balls sometime get stuck at the corners of the window.
